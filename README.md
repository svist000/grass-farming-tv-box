Transform your old TV box into a Grass farming device. This guide walks you through repurposing outdated hardware to create an efficient, low-cost node for cryptocurrency farming. If you want to farm on Android, please leave. We will transfrom Android box into a device with [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com/) OS. This tutorial is for A95X F3(almost same proccess with any TV Box with Amlogic CPU).
# Step 1: Install Armbian into TV BOX.
## Download the image
First, you should download an image of Armbian OS for [S9XX](https://www.armbian.com/amlogic-s9xx-tv-box/). You can check your box [here](https://github.com/devmfc/debian-on-amlogic/blob/main/README.md). I got A95X F3(S905X3) with cpu ARM Cortex-A55. I downloaded Armbian 25.2.0-trunk.13 Bookworm with Gnome for my own comfort. You can download the latest stable version and also without the Gnome, ItÂ´s up to you.
## Make bootable USB or SD-Card
You can use programms such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/sk/) or [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)
